# Website for LeeJon TaeKwonDo
A simple website I am working on, pro bono, for LeeJon TaeKwonDo, a studio I have attended for 10 years.
Everything is from scratch, coded by hand.
Will soon be deployed at leejon.com, to replace current website dating back to the 90s.
The layout is intentionally very simple, to reflect the simple content and function needed.
Homepage is leejonwebsite/home/index.html.
