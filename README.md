# Website for LeeJon TaeKwonDo
## Intro
A simple website I am working on, pro bono, for LeeJon TaeKwonDo, a studio I have attended for 10 years.
Everything is from scratch (no templates etc), coded by hand in React and Sass, with use of some npm packages.
Will soon be deployed at leejon.com, to replace current website dating back to the 90s.

## Branches
Branches `v1` and `v2` are the legacy versions of the site, written in January 2019. I wrote these versions immediately after teaching myself HTML and CSS. They are largely the same codebase; `v2` has an improved UI compared to `v1`.
After more coding experience, I picked up Javascript/React and wanted to refactor this site to better reflect my skill level and good coding practices. In November 2019 I began converting the site to React, making additional improvements along the way. This version is the current `master` and is what will be deployed.

## UI and Organization
The UI is intentionally very simple, to reflect the simple content and function needed.
I chose colors, fonts, and photos to reflect the studio's history and convey the environment of the studio.
The former website had what I considered to be a confusing organization, so I refactored the main pages in my design. For example, instead of having separate navigation links for several important resources, I combined the links under a 'Student Information' page.
The former website also lacked any information for prospective students/customers. To address this need, I created a homepage highlighting the studio's marketable points, and wrote welcoming copy on the contact page.

## Studio Owner's Influence
Since I made this site for a business, not all of the choices are entirely mine. I often emailed back and forth with the studio owner to clarify his wishes for his business's site. I based the website around his goals and deferred to his requests for several things. For example, the title font was not originally in Brush Script, but that font was requested for brand consistency. In addition, he asked that the Student Information page be password protected.
