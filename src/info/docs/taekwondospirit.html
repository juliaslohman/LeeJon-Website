                NATURE OF Taekwondo:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
                The nature of Taekwondo is founded on two fundamental aspects: Practical value
                and ideological value. The practical value of Taekwondo is found in the
                elemental movements of each technique and in the principles governing those
                movements. The ideological value of Taekwondo is found in the three ideals
                which form the identity of Taekwondo: the technical ideal, artistic ideal, and
                the philosophic ideal. Further, modern Taekwondo is a method of Physical
                Education and a system of competition. </span></p>

                The Technical Ideology of Taekwondo: The technical expression of Taekwondo
                originally derived its values from the practical aspects of training. Bare-hand
                self-defense and physical exercise for health were the basic practical benefits
                of Taekwondo. Therefore, the technical Ideal of Taekwondo was seen as the
                practical application of training and techniques to human living conditions.
                Even as an awareness of Taekwondo's other ideals emerge, the technical remains an
                essential element of Taekwondo training. The technical ideal, then, is embodied
                in the word "Musul" which describes its practical values. </span></p>
                
                <p style="margin-left:.5in"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">2.</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The Artistic Ideology of Taekwondo:
                Art arises from a state of mind and soul in union and is expressed through an
                action consistent with that union. When one devotes mind and soul to the
                refinement of Taekwondo skill, a sensation of exquisite achievement can be
                realized outside of the practical consideration of technical development. The
                sublimation of practical concerns into the desire to develop, complete, and
                perfect Taekwondo skills is the concept of "Muyeh," the artistic
                ideal of immersion of soul and body for the sake of perfection of action. </span></p>
                
                <p style="margin-left:.5in"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">3.</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The Philosophic Ideology of
                Taekwondo: The concept of "Do" is the central metaphysical concept
                which covers the entire realm of oriental philosophy. The philosophic ideal of
                Taekwondo training is the realization of the relationship between man and
                nature, of the universe as discovered through practicing, and how to live in
                harmony with that universe. This is the essence of "Mudo." A narrow
                sense of normative concepts such as "courtesy" and "sense of
                honor" have little to do with Taekwondo's philosophic ideal. Nor is this
                ideal found in technical values such as Poomse or the concept of a
                "deathblow." The philosophic ideal is moving away from an introverted
                mind toward an extroverted mind. </span></p>
                
                <p style="margin-left:.5in"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">4.</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The Nature of Taekwondo as Physical
                Education: Physical education is the systemized attempt to Integrate man's
                intelligence, emotion, and will through physical action. Taekwondo's technical,
                artistic, and philosophic ideology abound with educational values. Developing
                the physical body is the domain of technique, developing a concentrated spirit
                is the domain of art, and achieving a harmony between mind and body as well as
                understanding and cooperation with nature is the realm of Taekwondo philosophy.
                The philosophic objective of perfecting the human being through Taekwondo is a
                methodology of physical education's principles. Taekwondo has not been altered
                or exploited as a "new," modern form of physical training, but,
                instead, has always embodied the values of physical education. The essential
                values of Taekwondo, which begin to be formed through the technical ideal at
                the inception of training, and which come to maturity at the philosophic or
                "Do" stage, correspond with the nature of physical education, which
                exists to develop an ideal human being through physical training regime. </span></p>
                
                <p style="margin-left:.5in"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">5.</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The Nature of Taekwondo as a
                Competition: Competitions of strength are an expression of man's natural
                instincts. Historically, competitions of strength between men have been the
                most common of all competition patterns. The nature of Taekwondo's development
                as a form of competition has been that of a competition of strength which
                relies on skill for its proper expression. Man naturally desires to prove that
                he is superior to his opponent in competition. This desire combined with the
                resultant values derived from sincere efforts to develop technically and the human
                interaction of training and competitive confrontation, all shape the Taekwondo
                competition. These experiences and lessons, together with other factors such as
                sportsmanship, i.e., human responsibility, as well as pleasure and recognition,
                have led to the development if the concept of Taekwondo competition.
                Historically, Taekwondo developed as a "Hoe" or game. Therefore,
                Taekwondo as a martial art has an historical relationship with values of
                competition. The competitive Ideals of Taekwondo are power, quickness, and
                accuracy. The embodiment of these ideals in the training and competition
                process gives Taekwondo its unique identity as a modem sport. </span></p>

                Motives in Initiating Taekwondo Training: The initial motives for entering into
                Taekwondo training usually lie in desires to maintain or improve health, or
                self-protection. Yet other motives often expressed are the desire to cultivate
                the spirit, develop beautiful technique, or experience the pleasure of
                participation. These motives are expressions of desires arrived at from a lack
                of deep understanding as to the essential values of Taekwondo. As training
                progresses, the more sublime values of Taekwondo become gradually more
                apparent, finally fusing into strongly held, comprehensive goal. </span></p>

                Training: The objectives of training can be thought of the same the values one
                wishes to attain through training. Individuals bring any number of objectives
                to the training hall, some more specific than others. Some of these common
                values are: bodily health, mental health, a method of self-protection, and
                development of a life philosophy applicable to everyday living. However, such
                individual purposes are somewhat expressive of a superficial concept of Taekwondo.
                A much deeper concept exists beneath the surface of these initial objectives. A
                more comprehensive analysis of the objectives of Taekwondo training can bring
                one to believe that Taekwondo can change one's life. </span></p>

                Process of Internal Formation: Taekwondo spirit is formed directly from
                training, and is referred to as the internal formation process. This process
                can be further sub-divided into two dynamics: formation during the course
                training and spirit formed as the result of practice. </span></p>

                practice: Proper training requires total immersion in the training process. For
                this, one needs powerful concentration requiring an integrated mind,
                perseverance to challenge personal physical limitations, self-restraint to
                overcome the frustration of struggling with one's self, and courage to overcome
                fear of confrontation. All these characteristics help to form and cultivate the
                human will and spirit through the training process. Gradually, through the long
                process of training, the practitioner's mind becomes strong, broad and
                profound. </span></p>

                of training: The training process is life-long. After consistent training for a
                given period of time, however, man can achieve a certain level of proficiency
                in the basic techniques. The acquisition of real ability in Taekwondo
                techniques can bring about real change in man's mind. With the physical changes
                and technical improvement brought about as a result of training, man can feel
                at case and broad-minded in viewing his surroundings. This power, plus the
                power to command one's surroundings through a powerful will and spirit acquired
                through training, provide the foundation on which develop an altruistic man. In
                other words, this is the process of forming an active, positive spirit with
                which to command the environment instead of being overwhelmed by it. </span></p>

                process of internal formation of spirit either during the course of training or
                as a result of training, tends to be extremely subjective. Therefore, it is
                possible that the formation of spirit will be one-sided or even distorted. This
                is where a process of external adjustment or discipline is needed. Taekwondo
                training is not a process of subjective learning carried out in an isolated
                environment. The guidance of a qualified leader along with the influence of the
                traditions and disciplines of the gymnasium, practice arena, and senior and
                junior training partner relationships help give a positive direction to the
                trainee. In addition, it becomes possible for the trainee to perceive the value
                system of moral philosophy that Taekwondo has established through its long
                history, and he comes to learn how to apply it to his own life. This is the
                nature of oriental martial morality found specifically in Taekwondo. </span></p>

                The Meaning of Taekwondo Spirit: Spirit and mind are two words often confused
                in usage because of their similarity. However, spirit refers to the immaterial
                intelligence, which systematically establishes human thinking on the basis of
                value. Therefore Taekwondo spirit means the Taekwondo man's systematic thought
                process in regarding values established through Taekwondo training. When one
                reaches an improved ability to perceive the relative merit of things and act
                effectively and decisively as a result of training, then it can be said that
                Taekwondo spirit has been, to some extent, established and embodied. Not until
                a behavioral and moral philosophy have been established as a consequence of
                internal assimilation of the three dimensions of Taekwondo ideology, i.e.,
                technical, artistic, and philosophical, can it be said that a comprehensive
                Taekwondo spirit has been established. </span></p>
                
                <p style="margin-left:.5in"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">2.</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Technique and Spirit: Technique is
                the starting point as well as the ultimate goal of Taekwondo. All the intrinsic
                values of Taekwondo arise from technique and exist at any stage of development
                within and because of technique. Taekwondo spirit, therefore, starts with technique,
                develops itself within technique and arrives at perfection through technique.
                As one trains in a series of techniques which develop progressively from basic
                movements, Poomse and Gyoroogi to higher levels, spirit is likewise developed
                progressively and in concrete stages. The determinant in Taekwondo training Is
                called the reactive motion. Man, existing in a certain environment, is
                influenced by that environment and, in turn, acts against that environment. The
                medium through which each influence the other is the reactive motion. Practice
                of Taekwondo goes from reactive training in a primary field or environment in
                which an opponent is initially encountered, through a broader field in which
                the opponent is engaged, to the final field in which an absolute and infinite
                awareness of the environment is attained by transcending the opponent's
                awareness of the environment. If that awareness can be reached, no gap will
                exist between the state of an individual's internal consciousness and that of
                the external environment, and it would become possible for the individual to
                control and adjust the internal and external fields subjectively. This type of
                development of the spirit is accomplished by pure immersion of spirit into a
                technique and through the experiences and awakening within that technique.
                During fierce Gyoroogi or other confrontations, one's composure is not lost.
                The self and the opponent are both deeply and calmly viewed within the mind,
                action is neither feared nor avoided, all external concerns about result or
                outcome are discarded. </span></p>

                mental frame of the ideal human being which Taekwondo training seeks to
                develop. It is a mental image of the ideal Taekwondoist which the trainee carries.
                When the three dimensions of Taekwondo, i.e. technique, art, philosophy are
                integrated holistically to form another dimension of human personality, it is
                seen as the beginning of actualizing Taekwondo spirit. Taekwondo has a system
                of value built around two axes; martialism and morality or "Do."
                Taekwondo cultivates the spirit's energy through the rituals of training and
                through "Do" and attempts to integrate them into one. The product of
                that union is called "Chong" or propriety. Contained in this concept
                is the "Chong" referring to a clean heart and "Chong".
                referring to intrepidity, and finally "Chong' of restraint. Ultimately,
                then, Taekwondo in the form of education, sport, or human personification (or
                "Do") seeks a practical philosophy based on a martial morality which
                gives man a way to think and act with propriety and be recognized as an
                intrepid, altruistic human being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
